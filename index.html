                <p>Hello my name is Chad Dunlop. I'm glad you found my website! I'm a senior at the University of Oklahoma and I'll be graduating and entering the real world this December. I'll leave OU with a bachelors degree in Management Information Systems and a minor in Health, Physical Education and Recreation. I love technology but I know sports are my passion so I'll be trying to pursue a career where I can meet both interests.</p>
